# Timer library implementation
#
# A non-functional instance of the Timer Library that can be used as a template
#  for the implementation of a functional timer library instance. This library instance can
#  also be used to test build DXE, Runtime, DXE SAL, and DXE SMM modules that require timer
#  services as well as EBC modules that require timer services
